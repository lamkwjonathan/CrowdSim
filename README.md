# Crowd Simulation for Digital Twin Applications
This is a final year project focusing on the development of crowd simulation functionality for large-scale crowds. It heavily references the methods in [SPH crowds: Agent-based crowd simulation up to
extreme densities using fluid dynamics](https://inria.hal.science/hal-03270915/file/CAG2021-SPHCrowds%20-%20Author%20version.pdf).

## References
The UMANS code is taken and adapted from: https://gitlab.inria.fr/OCSR/UMANS (Accompanying paper: [Generalized Microscopic Crowd Simulation using Costs in Velocity Space](https://project.inria.fr/crowdscience/generalized-microscopic-crowd-simulation-using-costs-in-velocity-space-i3d-2020/)).

The ChAOS code is taken and adapted from: https://gitlab.inria.fr/OCSR/chaos.

Code in the `initial commit` of the `UMANS` and `ChAOS` folders are almost entirely by the original authors and all credit goes to them. For full references and accreditation, visit the above `GitLab` links.

My own additions can be found in the future commits.
